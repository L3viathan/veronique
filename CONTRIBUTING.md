If you want to help out with Véronique, come join [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/atvuVztJcN).

In particular, I'm currently looking for someone with design and/or CSS skills.
I'm not super happy with the logo, and some parts of the UI only really work on
Desktop.

There's also a few lower priority dev tasks on my queue, including (more)
tests, and packaging Véronique properly instead of just having a bunch of
Python files.

For information on how to set up a Véronique on your own, consult the README.
